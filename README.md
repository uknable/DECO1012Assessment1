Hello this is the repo for my DECO1012 Assessment 1 submission proving my work.

03/04/2018
started work on the project. My idea is a jigsaw puzzle of a flower that is spinning around and sheds petals. At first in its unsolved
state the puzzle will be grayscale. When the puzzle is solved it will have colour and the display will intensify.
I've laid down the groundwork of the initialisation and randomisation of the picture. I've used a placeholder graphic of concentric 
circles to make the randomisation obvious looking.

I will next need to implement the drag and drop functionality that I want my project to have, if that doesn't work then I will have to 
do a click-tile-then-click-tile-to-swap functionality which would be clunkier. After that I will be implementing the flower graphic.
Hopefully it won't be too resource demanding.
